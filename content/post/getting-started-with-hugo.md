# Getting familiar with Hugo

## Introduction

As part of the learning path, you will need to have hands-on experiencie with Git/Github.
Hugo is a popular site generator and we plan to use it to learn some `git` operations and real-world 
use cases.


### Day 1. Installation

1. Install hugo following the proper documentation https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/
2. Start a hugo server locally

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/gohugoio/hugoDocs.git
    cd hugoDocs
    hugo server
    ```
3. Read the documentation and get familiar with basic commands, e.g., create a new post, add content and build static files.

### Day 2. TBD
